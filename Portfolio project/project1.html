        <h4>A message from the connoisseur</h4>
        <p style="text-align:left;" class="card-text">This first project started with a simple prompt; make a video in 30 minutes. My group and I ran around our university campus trying to shoot some videos in hope to combine them into a meaningless, internet-worthy clip. While that felt entertaining, the prompt unfolded for a second mission seemingly impossible for me to achieve. Laconically, make a website to host your video.<br><br>I immediately thought that I will not follow a paved road. Making a website for only one video, that also barely carried meaning, did not seem as a constructive dedication of my time.<br><br>On a weekend morning, I come up with an idea. How about making it all about a product? Something that is useful. Something that solves a problem. As someone who edits a lot of videos for work, I knew the struggle of media management and other technical difficulties that interrupt the workflow. So, what if, my product was an AI-powered software that made all the editing for me? This would resolve the problem with our 30 minute video; rather than finding ideas on how to recycle that footage, I will let my program do the work.<br><br>With this idea, I started looking for a title. I have to admit that the outcome isn't original; CUTAI simply brings together "cut" (like in movies) and "AI". It's like starting a brand called KettleWarmer...<br><br></p>
        <h4>A few words about the process</h4>
        <p>It all started with a wireframe. I have exported most of my graphics as JPGs or PNGs and overlayed them on top of each other (as opposed to doing it all by code).<br><br>The contrasted colors refer to the two key elements of the project; the video editing aspect (orange color), and the role of AI (purple/blue color). <br><br>The overall color scheme of the website is dark in reference to professional video editing tools (such as Premiere Pro).</p>
