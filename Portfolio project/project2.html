        <h4>A message from the connoisseur</h4>
        <p style="text-align:left;" class="card-text">'A Piece of Dreamy Cake' was a story that Ons shared with us - a childhood nightmare about being stuck in a room with a cake that progressively grew larger. As a claustrophobic kid, this was quite a stressful experience for Ons, whereas the rest of the group (as adults) found the story quite amusing.<br><br>Here, we came up with an idea to divide one seemingly straightforward story into two different perspectives.<br><br>The leading thread is illustrated through monochrome drawings, calling for questions and curiosity. The Neutral version of the comics, which resides in the central panelWhen the user hovers on one side of the screen, they open a colored, pre-imagined angle on the story.<br><br>The one on the left exemplifies how a child would have reacted in this dream; dramatic and fearful, it is an adventurous story featuring heroes and strong emotions.<br><br>On the right, we have visualized an adult’s attitude in this situation; indifferent and somewhat boring, the drama is dissolved by transforming the horrifying into the mundane.<br><br>Together with our team, we created new dimensions to Ons’ dream by designing new characters, storylines and themes. This comic immerses the viewer into a polysemic and interactive setting, open to interpretation.<br><br>Our illustrations are broken down into seven main parts.<br><br>First, the header serves as a welcome page. As our tool of choice, Procreate allows us to draw with layers. We used this feature to create an animated feel using parallax scrolling for the different components.<br><br>Then, we used a vertical canvas to mimic a web-comic, inciting the user to continue scrolling further. They are next presented with a neutral perspective on the story with arrows on each side.</p>
