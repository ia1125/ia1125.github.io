Project name
CUTAI

Project description
The aim of this website is to showcase an imaginative product. CUTAI is an artificial-intelligence powered software that can edit videos by itself. It solves the time-consuming nature of video editing, and does not compromise the quality of the end result by providing the user with lots of customization options.
As a whole, this website is not tailored specifically to the 30MFF my team has created. Rather, it wraps around it to create a big-picture concept that could be more versatile to reuse in the future. It successfully hosts our short film in the "Try it out!" section, but suggesting how CUTAI would edit the most random clips we have shot into cohesive content; from a news report where all the clips illustrate the health guidelines appearing on the screen, to a youth-oriented newsletter video that shows ways to have fun at the Palms Plaza on campus.
In terms of UI design, the brand identity can be understood in two dimensions; modernity and professionalism. As CUTAI is powered by artificial intelligence, the main page (and other iterations) contain bright gradients, that refer to the mysterious, evolutive, and technological. The use of gradients in AI-like programs is recurrent, with examples such as Siri, Instagram, MyMind, etc. The professional side is perceived through the use a dark background (in fact not deep black but a lighter tint as to follow UI rules to soften contrasts) that can refer to the interfaces found in Adobe software. 

Project implementation
This project has been created with HTML and CSS. Most of the graphics are images, as well as some videos. 

Project evaluation
When comparing my initial ideas in the wireframe (a segment I am much more proficient in) with the coded result, I believe the overall goal has been achieved. The website has a finished impression, and I would feel confident sending it to my grandmother who would most likely understand the navigation and the concept of the website. On the other hand, the details do not correspond to my initial expectations; the menu is not functional and does not change color when scrolling past the first page,  the "Process" animation (although hand drawn) does not in fact fit in well with the professional side of the website. In addition, the "Try it out" menu lacks refinement in terms of positioning. I have removed the Javascript code for this section as its presence was giving a generally unfinished impression. Although not fully interactive and definitely not perfect, I believe the website is complete and presents the product on a level comparable to other businesses.
